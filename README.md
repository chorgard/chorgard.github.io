# Chorgard.github.io

![Chorgard](img/king.gif)\
[chorgard.github.io](https://chorgard.github.io) is just a hobbyist's website, not much.

### Purpose

This website's purpose is only to provide my workings and ideas with a small group of others.\
I like to experiment with html, javascript and Unity's WebGL build option.\
I also made *this* _Markdown_ file to **experiment** with markdown syntax.

### Usage

This website is free for everyone to visit and explore.  Please do not comment on how bad anything is\
on any platform.  Just suggest that something should change directly to me @ chorgard@outlook.com\

Yes, I use outlook.com.  It's more unique than the 99% of other emails ending with "@gmail.com".
